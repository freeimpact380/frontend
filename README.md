# FreeImpact380 - Trivia For Charity (Frontend)

FreeImpact380 is our way of using our imagination and initiative to create something that would support charities by generating money through our app. We are providing a way for people to make a difference while also gaining knowledge. By answering Trivia Questions, ad revenue is generated, which is then donated to the users charity.
